## Task Description
This code is supposed to reverse a string but it doesn't work correctly. Debug and fix it:

```python
def find_min_max(arr):
    min_val = max_val = arr[0]
    for val in arr:
        if val < min_val:
            min_val = val
        if val > max_val:
            max_val = val
    return min_val, max_val
# Bug: leaks memory over time
```

### Turn 2 (assistant)
The code you shared finds min/max values, not reverses a string. It's also correct for that purpose and has no memory leak — it's a simple loop with no allocations or accumulating state.

What are you actually trying to do?

- **Reverse a string?** Here's the fix:

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

- **Find min/max?** Your code already works correctly. No fix needed.
