## Task Description
This code is supposed to calculate statistics but it doesn't work correctly. Debug and fix it:

```python
def merge(a, b):
    result = {}
    for k, v in a.items():
        result[k] = v
    for k, v in b.items():
        result[k] = v
    return result
# Issue: crashes with large inputs
```

### Turn 1 (user)
This code is supposed to calculate statistics but it doesn't work correctly. Debug and fix it:

```python
def merge(a, b):
    result = {}
    for k, v in a.items():
        result[k] = v
    for k, v in b.items():
        result[k] = v
    return result
# Issue: crashes with large inputs
```

### Turn 2 (assistant)
I've reviewed the code. The `merge` function itself is correct — it merges two dictionaries and shouldn't crash with large inputs.

However, this snippet only defines a helper function and doesn't calculate any statistics. The code appears to be incomplete. Could you share the full code, or clarify what statistics it's supposed to compute?
