A user reported that this function leaks memory over time. Find the bug:

```python

        result[k] = v

# Issue: leaks memory over time
```

### Turn 2 (assistant)
This function doesn't have a memory leak. It's a pure function that creates a new dict and returns it — no global state, no caching, no circular references.

The leak is likely in the **caller code** that accumulates references to the returned dicts over time (e.g., appending results to a list in a loop). The `merge` function itself is fine.

If you want, share the code that *calls* `merge` and I can identify the actual leak there.
